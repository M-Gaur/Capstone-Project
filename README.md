# Capstone-Project
Data Analysis of the IT field and its demographics
This is a project completed under the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In this project, I analysed the popularity of different languages, platforms, web frames and databases used by IT professionals around the world and what IT professionals would like to work with in the coming year. In addition, I also looked at the age, location and gender demographics in the IT field.
Using the Github Jobs API in python, I collected data in various formats, including number of jobs available for different technologies and different locations.
I then scraped the IBM Website in order to gather the names of different languages and yearly wages of those using the languages. Survey data from the Stack Overflow developer survey was collected.
I then cleaned and analyzed the data to understand the full story, this was done by statistical analysis, where I looked at the correlations between variables, outliers were identified and hence I was able to gather a full picture.
Finally, to ensure the data is easily understood, I used Google Looker Studio to create visualisations that would aid in the understanding of the full story of current and future trends as well as the demographics in the IT field.
